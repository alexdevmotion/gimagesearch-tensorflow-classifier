# gimagesearch-tensorflow-classifier
A classifier similar to the google image search tool; categories: face, photo, clip art, line drawing
... with a state of the art GUI!


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.5 with pip


## Setting up
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow_hub
pip install flask
```
There may be other requirements which I missed; just do a pip install of whatever missing module pops up


## Firing up the app
#### Windows only
Linux users, I'm sure you'll figure out how to rewrite the complex start script :)
```
start.cmd
```
